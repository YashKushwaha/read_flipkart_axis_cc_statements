# Credit Card Statement Parser

## Overview
This Python program extracts transaction data from credit card statements (PDF files) and saves the extracted data into a structured Excel (`.xlsx`) file. Currently, the program supports **Flipkart Axis Bank** credit card statements, with plans to expand support for other banks in the future.

## Features
- Reads multiple credit card statement PDFs from a specified folder.
- Extracts transaction details such as **date, description, amount, and type (debit/credit)**.
- Supports **password-protected PDFs** (user provides password at runtime).
- Saves extracted transactions into a **tabular Excel format (`.xlsx`)**.
